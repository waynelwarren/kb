Cloning a disk.

Boot from a USB drive so that the source disk on the host computer is available.

Cannot clone onto smaller disk. But can use 'gparted' to shrink the partitions of source disk first.

Use 'sfdisk' to create the same partition layout on a second disk:
    sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sudo sfdisk /dev/sdb

Then, for every partition, do:

    dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1
    dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sdb2

To copy the boot sector:

    dd if=/dev/sda of=mbr.bak bs=512 count=1
    dd if=mbr.bak of=/dev/sdb bs=446 count=1

Alternative to dd from source to target partitions:
    rsync -av /mount/point/of/large/partition/ /mount/point/of/small/partition
(beware of recursive copying)

clonezilla is recommended to copy partition-by-partition. Assumes partition sizes match.
